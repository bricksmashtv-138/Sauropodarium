<p>Here are just some of the many sources I use all the time doing research.</p>

<p><a href="https://theropoddatabase.com">The Theropod Database</a>, by far the best source for information on Mesozoic theropods, & heavily influential in the design of this website.<br>
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paleofile.com">Paleofile</a>, another hugely influential website that includes much of the data on non-theropods used here, & covers Mesozoic life as a whole.<br>
</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164521/http://dml.cmnh.org/">The Archives of the Dinosaur Mailing List</a>,
which contains all the discussions that occured on the DML from its inception to March of 2021 when the CMNH stopped hosting 
the archives. You can sign up for the new Dinosaur Mailing Group & view previous archives <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/DinosaurMailingGroup">
